### Overview

In this project I examined the most lucrative college undergraduate majors. With this information, I then examined trends in 2017-2019 SAT data by intended college major and by average scores per U.S. state. Scores and participation rates were analyzed to uncover underlying patterns between SAT scores and undergraduate major choice in an effort to provide suitable recommendations on which states to recruit prospective students, and where to allocate university program funding.

The data used for this project are from the following sources: [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/info-Degrees_that_Pay_you_Back-sort.html), [2019 SAT by College Major](http://localhost:8889/files/project_1/data/sat_2019_by_intended_college_major.csv?_xsrf=2%7C4a6b3cac%7Cfeba3ecee7ec64ff988cd860a0ed4f4c%7C1665416297), [2017 SAT by State](http://localhost:8889/files/project_1/data/sat_2017.csv?_xsrf=2%7C4a6b3cac%7Cfeba3ecee7ec64ff988cd860a0ed4f4c%7C1665416297), [2018 SAT by State](http://localhost:8889/files/project_1/data/sat_2018.csv?_xsrf=2%7C4a6b3cac%7Cfeba3ecee7ec64ff988cd860a0ed4f4c%7C1665416297), [2019 SAT by State](http://localhost:8889/files/project_1/data/sat_2019.csv?_xsrf=2%7C4a6b3cac%7Cfeba3ecee7ec64ff988cd860a0ed4f4c%7C1665416297)

### Summary of Findings and Recommendations 

The highest earning majors are Engineering, Computer Science, Physics and Economics. Those who intend to pursue these majors tend to score higher on all portions of the SAT than those who do not. The SAT math section has the largest score difference between the highest earning majors and all other majors. The states that had favorable Total, EBRW and Math SAT scores were consistent across 2017-2019. Finally, states with higher participation rates have lower test scores. 

Based on the data examined, it is recommended that funding and scholarships be allocated to the Engineering, Computer Science, Physics and Economics departments, as they are the most lucrative majors. Students who intend to pursue one of the above degrees score on average 6-8% higher in all areas of the SAT, with the biggest discrepancy being math. While there are key states to recruit that have favorable test scores (Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Wisconsin and Wyoming), this data fails to provide an accurate representation of high performing students among states with higher participation rates. More data would be required to make fair recruitment recommendations. Finally, it is recommended that to grow the above programs, a portion of the department funding goes toward programs that give high-school students access to math education, as this is a barrier of entry for pursuing one of the highest earning degrees.
